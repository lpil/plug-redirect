PlugRedirect
============

A plug for performing redirects based upon request path.


## Usage

Add PlugRedirect to your Mix dependencies

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    {:plug_redirect "~> 0.0"},
  ]
end
```

Fetch it:

```
mix deps.get
```

Create a new module and specify your redirects like so:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.RedirectPlug do
  use Plug.Redirect

  # Argument #1 is the 30x status code to use
  # Argument #2 is the path to redirect from
  # Argument #3 is the path to redirect to

  redirect 301, "/ada",   "/lovelace"
  redirect 302, "/grace", "/hopper"
  redirect 303, "/adele", "/goldberg"
  redirect 307, "/sandi", "/metz"
end
```

This compiles into a plug that you can insert into your application's
plug middleware stack.

In Phoenix, insert the plug in your web application Endpoint.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Endpoint do
  use Phoenix.Endpoint, otp_app: :my_app

  plug Plug.RequestId
  plug Plug.Logger

  # After the logger is a good spot to insert
  plug MyApp.RedirectPlug

  plug Plug.MethodOverride
  plug Plug.Head

  plug MyApp.Router
end
```
