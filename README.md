A plug builder for redirecting requests.


## Usage

Add PlugRedirect to your Mix dependencies

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    {:plug_redirect, "~> 0.0"},
  ]
end
```

Fetch it:

```
mix deps.get
```

Create a new module and specify your redirects like so:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Redirector do
  use Plug.Redirect

  # Argument #1 is the 30x status code to use
  # Argument #2 is the path to redirect from
  # Argument #3 is the path to redirect to
  redirect 301, "/ada",   "/lovelace"
  redirect 302, "/grace", "/hopper"
  redirect 303, "/adele", "/goldberg"
  redirect 307, "/sandi", "/metz"

  # When no status code is supplied it defaults to 301
  redirect "/margaret", "/hamilton"

  # Segements prefixed with a colon will match anything
  redirect "/blog/:anything", "/blog-closed"
end
```

This compiles into a plug that you can insert into your application's
plug middleware stack.

In Phoenix, insert the plug in your web application Endpoint.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Endpoint do
  use Phoenix.Endpoint, otp_app: :my_app

  plug Plug.RequestId
  plug Plug.Logger
  plug Plug.MethodOverride
  plug Plug.Head

  plug MyApp.Redirector # Insert your redirector anywhere before the router
  plug MyApp.Router
end
```
